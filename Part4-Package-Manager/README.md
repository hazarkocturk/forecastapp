# Part 4 - Package Manager

## ðŸŒ± Must-have's

1. We have installed **npm** before: typing `npm -v` in the terminal should return the **npm** version.
2. In your project's folder you should see a file called `package.json`: this is called a Manifest file, something like a "setting" file.
3. Inside the `package.json` file you will see a lot of different properties. One of those properties is **script**.
    * Scripts can be used to create shortcuts in the command prompt/shell.
    * Remember before? We already used this to run a **bundler**.
   ```
      "scripts": {
         ...
         "build": "webpack"
      },
   ```
    * Add a property build to your script (see above) and try to build and run your project in your terminal with the script shortcuts
   ```
   npm run build
   or
   yarn build
   -
   npm run start
   or
   yarn start
   ```
4. In this exercise you we use images, charts and dates. Those can sometimes take a lot of our time to get it done.
    * Replace the code that makes dates with a library such as [**Luxon**](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/). If this isn't useful for the kind of project your picked for this exercise, you may choose a different library that seems interesting.

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-have's

1. What other useful scripts could you add? What other helpful packages could you use?
2. Most bundlers have the option of generating a bundle for the "development" environment (that is your local computer _while_ you are developing your app) or for the "production" environment (that is the file that will actually be uploaded to the remote server). Read up on it and test it out on a deployment platform.

_Hint: When you install the first package via **npm** you will notice a new folder called `node_modules`. This is where all dependencies are saved. We don't want to commit the full `node_modules` folder since it's large (it can be several GBs, and thousands of files!) and its content can always be reproduced starting from a `package-lock.json` file.  
Add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore` file if you haven't already._
